# A Formalization of Jürg Kohlas' Information Algebra

## Overview

This repository represents a formalization of [Jürg Kohlas' Information Algebra](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4471-0009-6) text in [Lean4](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/).

It is an opportunity to learn about both formalization in Lean4 and about the contents of the text.

## Progress

This is a work-in-progress; right now I'm still on Chapter 2. I'm taking several different basic approaches to defining the nominal structures and exploring implementing a basic lemma with them. Right now "Draft 6" seems to be the most promising.
