# A Formalization of Jürg Kohlas' Information Algebra

## Overview

This repository represents a formalization of [Jürg Kohlas' Information Algebra](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4471-0009-6) text in [Lean4](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/).

The work has also kind of bled out into [Shafer and Shenoy's Local Computation in Hypertrees](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244434234_Local_Computations_in_Hypertrees) which is rich and from which Kohlas' text draws a lot of its concrete foundations.

It is an opportunity to learn about both formalization in Lean4 and about the contents of the texts.

## Progress

This is a work-in-progress; right now I'm still on Chapter 2 in both Kohlas and Shafer and Shenoy.
